# Financial API

## API Structure
This is the version 1 of the API, so all requests begin
with ``` /api/v1/<the-endpoint> ```

|          Endpoint          | HTTP Method |                                                  Result                                                  |

### Users

#### Endpoint /api/v1/users
You can create users by receiving: name, email and age.


#### Input:
```
{"name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane@email.com", "age": 23}
```

#### Output:
```
{
    "pk": 1,
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@email.com",
    "age": 23
}
````


#### Endpoint  /api/v1/users
You can see all users


#### Output:
```
[
    {
        "pk": 1,
        "name": "Jane Doe",
        "email": "jane@email.com",
        "age": 23
    },
    {
        "pk": 2,
        "name": "Luis Suarez",
        "email": "testuser@email.com",
        "age": 42
    }
]
````


#### Endpoint /api/v1/users/1
Also, you can see the details of a specific user.


#### Output:
```
{
    "pk": 1,
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@email.com",
    "age": 23
}
```


### Transactions

#### Endpoint /api/v1/transactions/
You can create users' transactions. Each transaction has: reference
(unique), account, date, amount, type, category and is related to a user.


#### Input:
```
{"reference": "000051", "account": "S00099", "date": "2020-01-13", "amount": "-51.13", "type": "outflow", "category": "groceries", "user_id": 2}
```

#### Output:
```
{
    "reference": "000051",
    "account": "S00099",
    "date": "2020-01-13",
    "amount": "-51.13",
    "type": "outflow",
    "category": "groceries",
    "user": 2
}
```

#### Remember:
- A transaction reference is unique.
- There are only two type of transactions: inflow and outflow.
- All outflow transactions amounts are negative decimal numbers.
- All inflow transactions amounts are positive decimal numbers.
- We expect to receive transactions in bulk as well.
- The transactions we receive could be already in our system, thus we need to avoid duplicating them in our database.

### Summaries
This is the interesting part. Here we are going to be able to have some insights
related to our users and their behavior with money.

#### Account Summary

Here we are able to see a user's summary by account that shows the balance
of the account, total inflow and total outflows.

Output:
```
[
 {"account": "C00099", "balance": "1738.87", "total_inflow": "2500.72", "total_outflow": "-761.85"},
 {"account": "S00012", "balance": "150.72", "total_inflow": "150.72", "total_outflow": "0.00"},
]

```

It is also possible to specify a date range, if no date range is given all
transactions should be considered.

Just try this and you will see a different output ;)

```
api/v1/users/1/account-summary?start_date=01-01-2020&end_date=12-01-2020
```
#### Output:
```
the output
```


#### Summary by Category

Here we are able to see a user's summary by category. This one shows the sum
of amounts per transaction type: (inflow or outflow)


#### Output:
```
{"inflow": {"salary": "2500.72", "savings": "150.72"}, "outflow": {"groceries": "-51.13", "rent": "-560.00", "transfer": "-150.72"}}
```


## How to Run

### Using Docker
Let's pray to the Demo Gods and let's start making some API calls.

0. Make sure you have the docker engine running and to install docker compose ;)
1. Run ```docker-compose up --build```
2. Voil√†, you should be ready to go and start making those calls

### Using Python's virtual environment
1. If you want to run the application from python's virtual environment go to ```financial_api/financial_api/```
and create a ```.env``` file with the following vars:

```
DATABASES_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2
DATABASES_NAME=financial_api_db
DATABASES_USER=financial_api_user
DATABASES_PASSWORD=3x4mpl3P455w0rd
DATABASES_HOST=localhost
DATABASES_PORT=5432
```

2. Make sure you have Postgres running

3. If you don't have Postgres, don't worry just add ``` IS_SQLITE=True ``` to
the ```.env``` file and you should be ready to go

4. Make sure you are running the virtual environment, otherwise just source it:
```
source env/bin/activate
```
5. Now go to your terminal and run:
```
python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver
```

### Testing
This application has 2 types of tests
  - Views
  - Models

To run them, all you need to do is ``` python manage.py test ```

## Tips
This is **not production ready**. Things such as the debugger and the secret
are out there in the plain. Also, make sure to add some other components such
as authentication, authorization, a rate-limiter, and logging. If you want to
